        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> I moved to Brooklyn to pursue a degree in graphic design. After a few years working in the design industry, I realized it just wasn't for me. But now I get to do web design! Which I love because I get to solve problems and collaborate on projects with other great developers.</p>
        <p> If you are looking for a junior developer or want to hear more about my background please don't hesitate to reach out to me via one of the contact links below!  </p>
